# 📱 Fundraising Intern Portal — Flutter Internship Round 1

Hello! 👋  
This is my submission for the **Flutter Development Internship [She Can! Foundation] — Round 1 Task**.

This Flutter app is a **prototype** of a simple fundraising intern portal.  
It uses **dummy/mock data only** — no backend or real authentication.  
The goal is to showcase **UI design**, **screen flow**, and **state storage basics**.

---

## ⚙️ **Features**

✅ **Sign Up & Sign In Screens**  
- Forms with text fields: Name, Email, Phone, Password, Referral Code  
- No real authentication — local mock only

✅ **Dashboard**  
- Shows intern’s **Name**, **Dummy Referral Code** (`athif2005`), and **Total Donations Raised** (e.g., ₹5,000)  
- Static **Rewards / Unlockables** (placeholder cards)

✅ **Leaderboard**  
- Static list of top fundraisers with ranks  
- Medal icons for Top 3, highlight for Top 5

✅ **Announcements**  
- Static messages for interns  
- Dummy news & updates

✅ **Profile**  
- Shows saved intern details (Name, Email, Phone)  
- Editable Bio & Bank Details (`SharedPreferences`)  
- Log out option

✅ **Bonus**  
- Clean UI with **custom widgets** (`CustomTextField`, `PrimaryButton`)  
- **Google Fonts** for better typography  
- Uses **SharedPreferences** for local mock storage
